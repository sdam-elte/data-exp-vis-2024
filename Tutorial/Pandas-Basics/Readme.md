# The `pandas` library

The easiest way to store our measurement data instead of `numpy.array`s or `list`s is the `DataFrame` class of the `pandas` library. Here, apart from storing the numbers, we can also label the rows and the columns, and we can have a different type in each column. 

We can think of a `DataFrame` as a common Excel table, because the methods that belong to this class are very similar to functions from Excel.

Next, we are going to have a look at the various possibilities of `pandas`.

1. accessing data, `DataFrame` class, reading and writing files [link](01-Pandas_load_data.ipynb)
2. simple operations, masking [link](02-Pandas_basic_operations.ipynb)
3. database 1. (groupby) [link](03-Pandas_groupby.ipynb)
4. statistics and plotting (seaborn) [link](04-Pandas_stat_plot.ipynb)
5. database 2. (concat, join, apply, pivot) [link](05-Pandas_adv_topics.ipynb)
